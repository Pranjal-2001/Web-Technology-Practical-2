            Sundar Pichai, in full Pichai Sundararajan, (born June 10, 1972, Madras [now Chennai], Tamil Nadu, India), Indian-born 
            American executive who was CEO of both Google, Inc. (2015– ), and its holding company, Alphabet Inc. (2019– ).
        </p>
        <p>As a boy growing up in Madras, Pichai slept with his brother in the living room of the cramped family home, but 
                his father, an electrical engineer at the British multinational GEC, saw that the boys received a good education.
        </p>
        <p> At an early age Pichai displayed an interest in technology and an extraordinary memory, especially for telephone 
                numbers. After earning a degree in metallurgy (B.Tech., 1993) and a silver medal at the Indian Institute of 
                Technology Kharagpur, he was awarded a scholarship to study at Stanford University (M.S. in engineering and 
                materials science, 1995). He remained in the United States thereafter, working briefly for Applied Materials
                 (a supplier of semiconductor materials) and then earning an M.B.A. (2002) from the Wharton School of the University 
                 of Pennsylvania.
